# Maria Flores

## Deployment

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages automatically via GitHub Actions.

### Automatic deployment

Every push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds and publishes the site.

### Manual deployment (fallback)

If needed, you can still publish manually:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### URL

The site is available at:
`https://exilium-informatica.github.io/mariaflores/`
